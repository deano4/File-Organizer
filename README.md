# File Organizer
#### Description:
File Organizer (my project) was designed to help organize multiples files into folders for better organization.
This was a problem when I looked at my own Downloads folder which was cluttered with a bunch of files.

File Organizer has a button to select the targeted folder. Alongside it is a view of the contents of the file.
There's 2 basic options to srot all the files in the targeted folder, by type and by date. Sorting by date results in 
folders created based on the date the file was created. Similiarily, soriting by type results in folders created based
on the type the file is. 

Additionally, there's a button for Additional Details to more specifically sort the files. 
Sorting by type then requires user to input a specific type and only makes a folder for that specific type. Sorting
by name with additional details requires users to select 2 dates (using a calandar widget), which then files within
that time range will be sorted into their corresponding date folders. Additional Details also allows for another sort
option, sort by name. Sort by name will allow users to search files that contain a particular word and organize them
into a folder. 

After selecting the sort option and filling out the other required field, users must click the 'sort' button, which
will then show a preview of the new folders and content in a widget below. After confirming that it what the user 
wants, users should click apply. There's also an undo button if it isn't what the user wanted
